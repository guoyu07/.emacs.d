>"Emacs outshines all other editing software in approximately the same way that the noonday sun does the stars. It is not just bigger and brighter; it simply makes everything else vanish." -Neal Stephenson, "In the Beginning was the Command Line"

>"Show me your ~/.emacs and I will tell you who you are." -Bogdan Maryniuk

>"Emacs is like a laser guided missile. It only has to be slightly mis-configured to ruin your whole day." -Sean McGrathi

>"While any text editor can save your files, only Emacs can save your soul." -Per Abrahamseni

>"Lisp isn't a language, it's a building material." - Alan Kay

>"The reasonable man adapts himself to Emacs; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt Emacs to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man." - G.B. Shaw

>"Compared to Emacs Wizards, graphical-IDE users are the equivalent of amateur musicians, pawing at their instrument with a sort of desperation. An IDE has blinking lights and pretty dialogs that you can't interact with properly, and gives newbies a nice comfortable sense of control. But that control is extremely crude, and all serious programmers prefer something that gives them more power." - Steve Yegge


## Philosophy

This is my third emacs reset. I love emacs, but I dont really like the default editing experience. I was previously an evil user, but after some thought, I decided to implement something inspired by the IntelliJ editing experience.
